## I gave up haha
I tried to edit binhex's scripts to trigger ovpn picker when port-forwarding fails. Spent some hours trying it but lost interest as it's too complicated for me.
The key complication is that binhex makes things to run in a fixed (and logical) order so adding the ovpn recyling step breaks the order. I have only managed to get it so that openvpn restarts successfully but there are still the privoxy and rtorrent steps.
